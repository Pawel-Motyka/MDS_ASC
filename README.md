#### Abstract:
<p align=" justify"> The goal of the study is to create an empirically grounded classification of altered states of consciousness based on subjective ratings of dissimilarity between them. Altered states of consciousness are operationally defined as transient change in the overall pattern of subjective experience, wherein individuals feel that their consciousness qualitatively deviates from the 'normal' baseline state (Revonsuo, 2010, p. 230); Tart, 1975). Despite a rapidly growing knowledge about the so-called 'level of consciousness' – delineating a range of states from coma and anaesthesia, through sleep phases, to the waking state – the debate concerning the qualitative diversity of states within wakefulness seems to be at an impasse. A fundamental challenge persists in determining the dimensions that are critical for effectively differentiating states of consciousness (e.g., Bayne et al., 2016). In the current study, we propose to use a novel 'bottom-up' approach to create a comprehensive classification of pharmacologically-induced altered states of consciousness based on multidimensional scaling techniques (MDS, Kruskal, 1964; Shepard, 1980; Hout et al., 2012). In an online study, adult participants were tasked with assessing the dissimilarity between pairs of subjective experiences related to the use of pre-selected psychoactive substances and comparing these experiences to the normal/baseline state. With the use of MDS we construct spatial models that represent the averaged dissimilarity ratings between particular states as distances in a geometric space. Our primary goal is to determine in a bottom-up manner the dimensions critical for effective classification of qualitatively varied consciousness states.

#### Steps to reproduce the analysis:
- download the entire repository as a zip-file 
- open the relevant code files in the downloaded folder (by clicking, i.e. not directly from R studio, as the “here” function is used for setting the directory)
- make sure that you have all the required packages installed (they are loaded in the first chunk of each code file)
- for each code file, run the analysis chunk by chunk in sequential order.

The folder “_data” will contain both raw data files for each subject and the preprocessed data frames. The relevant data frames will be automatically read while running individual code files.

The folder “_figures” will contain the main and supplementary plots.

R Markdown reports (HTML files) present all the code files used along with their outputs.
