#### Abstract:
<p align=" justify"> While states of consciousness are increasingly better understood across a spectrum from unconsciousness (e.g., coma or anesthesia) to the waking state, we lack a successful approach for capturing the qualitative diversity within wakefulness. A fundamental challenge seems to lie in identifying the dimensions that can effectively organize the coarse-grained representation of the experiential landscape. This preregistered study aimed to develop an empirically grounded classification of pharmacologically induced altered states using a bottom-up approach. Participants (n = 739) assessed the subjective dissimilarity between pairs of vividly remembered experiences associated with the use of various psychoactive substances. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) was employed to model these dissimilarities as distances in a geometric space.  The primary dimension, interpreted as the 'intensity of mind alteration', positioned baseline/ordinary state alongside states evoked by depressants, and stimulants at one end, while situating psychedelic- and dissociative-induced states at the other. The second dimension covered the inhibition-stimulation spectrum, ranging from states evoked by depressants and opioids to classical stimulants. The MDS was complemented by other multidimensional reduction techniques (PCA, UMAP, t-SNE), preserving subject-level information. We propose that such an approach may eventually inform our understanding of the dimensionality and topology underlying the landscape of human-accessible consciousness states.

#### Steps to reproduce the analysis:
- download the entire repository as a zip-file 
- open the relevant code files in the downloaded folder (by clicking, i.e. not directly from R studio, as the “here” function is used for setting the directory)
- make sure that you have all the required packages installed (they are loaded in the first chunk of each code file)
- for each code file, run the analysis chunk by chunk in sequential order.

The folder “_data” will contain both raw data files for each subject and the preprocessed data frames. The relevant data frames will be automatically read while running individual code files.

The folder “_figures” will contain the main and supplementary plots.

R Markdown reports (HTML files) present all the code files used along with their outputs.
